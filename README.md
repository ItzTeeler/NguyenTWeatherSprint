// Weather Sprint
// (Desc) In the application, it is an online Weather Application that will show you're current location's weather if you allow the website to access your GeoLocation. It will also give a 5 day forecast depending on what your current day is. There will also be a favorite button you are able to click and save into a list to see your favorite list. You will also be allowed to search for a location using the search bar. When you refresh the page your favorite locations will be saved in your localstorage so when you come back to my page your favorites will be saved.
