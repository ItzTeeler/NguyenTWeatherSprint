// Weather Sprint
// (Desc) In the application, it is an online Weather Application that will show you're current location's weather if you allow the website to access your GeoLocation. It will also give a 5 day forecast depending on what your current day is. There will also be a favorite button you are able to click and save into a list to see your favorite list. You will also be allowed to search for a location using the search bar. When you refresh the page your favorite locations will be saved in your localstorage so when you come back to my page your favorites will be saved. 
This whole project was created using HTML ,CSS and JS.
API used in this project came from ("https://openweathermap.org/api")
Current Weather Data = ("https://openweathermap.org/current")
5 day weather forecast = ("https://openweathermap.org/forecast5")

layout - the gif works perfectly, and the layout looks pretty similar to the figma.

Current forecast - the fahrenheit and celcius should be moved up a little

5 day forecatst - when you click the drop down, the current weather icon shifts a little.
also when you click the drop down, the header for the 5 day forecast doesn't disappear
The hr's under each drop down should have some margin lefts and right
the 5 day forecast icons should also be lined up with each other

search bar- when you type in a city, it doesn't add it into the recents list
favorites drop doesn't blend into the search bar
